<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Steven Corrales. I am 28 years old, Colombian-American that was born in 
  New Jersey and lives in Georgia. I am fluent in both Spanish and English.</p>
  
<p>I work in software engineering and have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from The Georgia
  Institute of Technology. My fascination with all things software and hardware began in my childhood
  with my fascination with all things Nintendo, and performing internal and external modifications on my
  consoles.</p>
  
<p>A few of my hobbies are singing, acting, playing pickleball and ultimate frisbee, and
  caring for and collecting various houseplants.</p>
  
<p>I have been working in mobile software development since graduation, and am currently working 
  on full-stack web development. Stay tuned-in to this page so that you can see my progress.</p>
